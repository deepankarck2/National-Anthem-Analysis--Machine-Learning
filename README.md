# National-Anthem-Analysis--Machine-Learning
In this project, I used natural language processing (NLP) techniques and k-means clustering to cluster a set of 190 national anthems based on their English lyrics and identify the patterns and themes shared by groups of countries with similar cultural or historical similarities by clustering them into different categories.

## Abstract 

<p align="justify">
 In this study, we used natural language processing (NLP) techniques and k-means clustering to
cluster a set of 190 national anthems based on their English lyrics. National anthems play a
significant role in shaping a country's national identity and promoting unity and pride among its
citizens. They are often used to express national values and ideals. In this paper, we will identify
the patterns and themes that can be shared by groups of countries with similar cultural or
political histories by clustering them into different categories. We first preprocess the lyrics of
the national anthems by removing stop words and stemming the remaining words. We then use
NLP techniques called Tf-Idf, which can help identify the most important words in a document
or a collection of documents. Then We then used the k-means algorithm to cluster the anthems
into five groups based on the similarity of their lyrics using the Tf-Idf vector of numbers. Then
we tested and evaluated the performance of the model using exploratory data analysis method.
Our results showed that the model was able to quite accurately group the national anthems into
clusters that reflected shared themes and cultural influences. This study provides a novel
approach to analyzing national anthems and has the potential to inform research on cultural and
political trends, as well as to serve as a resource for educational applications for understanding
what role does anthem play in a nationâ€™s identity.

# Background and Motivation:
<p align="justify">
  Clustering national anthems into different categories based on their lyrics can provide
  insight into the themes and values that are important to a particular country. For example, some
  national anthems may focus on themes related to nature, such as the beauty of the country or the
  bravery of its people. Others may focus on themes related to the nation's history or cultural
  traditions. Still, others may focus on themes related to love and devotion to the nation or its
  leader.
  The motivation for this project was lyrical analysis of the national anthems, by clustering
  them, to identify patterns and themes that may be shared by groups of countries with similar
  cultural or political histories. This could give a new lens of how we perceive a national anthem
  reveals the factors that shape national identity from the anthem and can help gain a deeper
  understanding of the values and themes that are important to a particular country.
